# Password Generator


## Overview

I've created an application that generates a random password based on the user's input. The app will run in the browser.
 
When being prompted to generate a password, the user will be prompt to choose from the a list of password criteria. The application should validate user input and ensure that at least one character type is selected.

Once all prompts are answered, the user will be presented with a password matching the answered prompts. The password will be displayed in the text field and can also be copied to your clipboard.

## Business Contenet

This app can be very useful for anyone who needs a strong password. Large companies that need to be able to save time and have an app that can genberate these random strong passwords would find this app to be very useful.
